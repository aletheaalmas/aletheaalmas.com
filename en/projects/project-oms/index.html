        <h1>OMS-Accounting Integration Project</h1>

        <section id="overview">
          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>
            Integrating <b>Ginee</b> Order Management System (OMS) with
            <b>Accurate Online</b>
            (Accounting System) was one of my most exciting project. Many OMS
            users are companies that need to manage their online sales from
            various marketplaces. At the same time, they also need to
            synchronize their sales records with their accounting system.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here’s how the process works: once an order is paid on the
            marketplace, it is synced to the OMS and then OMS will pushed the
            transaction record and stock update to the Accounting system. After
            launching this integration, users were eager to explore more, and
            the number of potential users increased by approximately
            <b>20–30%</b>, as they wanted to use both systems seamless.
          </p>

          <h2>My Contributions</h2>
          <p>
            I worked closely with the product team, starting with deep research
            on user needs and studying how competitors approached similar
            integrations. We soon discovered that the process was far more
            complex than expected. It wasn’t just about syncing sales data. Both
            system needed to record all business transactions, including:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Mapping journal entries for each store</li>
            <li>How products are created and purchased</li>
            <li>How sales transactions are recorded</li>
            <li>How to handling cancellations or returns</li>
            <li>Recording receipts, including marketplace fees and taxes</li>
            <li>And other related processes</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            I explored the accounting system’s features and APIs, and
            collaborated with their technical team to figure out the best way to
            connect both systems.
          </p>

            height="478"
          />
          <p>
            From there, I mapped out which features should be linked, created
            user flows, and helped define the integration design. I also
            prepared training materials to support onboarding and assisted in
            handling issues post-launch. This project not only improved our
            product ecosystem but also taught me how technical collaboration can
            create real value for users.

            After extensive effort, the integration between OMS and AOL was
            successfully launched, covering product, purchasing, and sales
            synchronization, with ongoing improvements planned.
